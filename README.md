## About

UBarter is the quick-and-easy web application that allows users to post items that they wish to trade; in return, they can request items that they need. Our application helps users find others to trade with. The focus for this service is on UMass school supplies. In short, the application is Tinder for textbooks. Similarly to Tinder, users make profiles of what they have and what they want. What differentiates Tinder’s algorithm from ours is that we match users for them, instead of a “swipe left/right” functionality on incompatible or compatible trades respectively.

UBarter utilizes a “listing” based system, listings are a collection of items a user wishes to trade with other users. The user creates listings and posts them to their profile. These trades can be as simple as one textbook for another. We take things a step further and add an “other items” section for trades such as a desk chair, backpack and helmet in exchange for a bean bag chair and a dresser. For users who do not wish to trade such as graduating seniors, we also have a sell for money option. Another additional feature will allow users to bargain for prices - like you can on Ebay - by submitting offers to the seller and the seller can either accept, counter-offer, or deny. Our platform suggests the trade to both users and if both accept, we show each user the contact section of the others profile, allowing them to exchange the items in-person or through mail.
